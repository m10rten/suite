# Most Used

Explore the most used utilities and tools in this showcase.

> **Note**: These are mostly preferenced by the author and may not be the best choice for your project.

## TZod - Utility Class(es)

The `TZod` package is without a doubt the most useful and best built, maintained and tested package in this showcase. It provides a set of utility classes that are most useful in any project.

It can do transformations, validations, and more with ease.

### Example

As you would with `zod`, you import the `t` namespace from `@mvdlei/tzod` and use it to do what you need.

#### To functions

The `to` namespace provides functions to convert values to a specific type.

```typescript
import { t } from "@mvdlei/node";

const url = t.to.url("https://example.com");
// url is now a URL object
```

Read more about `TZod` [here](./node/tzod).

## Web - Simplified Fetch

The `web` package is a simplified and upgraded fetch tool. It provides an extended version of the `fetch` function with defaults for headers and base URL.
This makes it super easy to send and receive JSON data from endpoints.

### Example

As you would call `fetch`, you import the `api` function from `@mvdlei/web` and use it to make requests.

```typescript
import { api } from "@mvdlei/web";

const response = await api("https://api.github.com/users/octocat");

// or with parameters
const response = await api("https://api.example.com", {
  params: {
    key: "value",
  },
});

// or make a POST request
const response = await api.post("https://api.example.com/login", {
  body: JSON.stringify(...data),
});


// or with a private endpoint from env:
const response = await api("/private/endpoint");
// will get process.env.API_URL or process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL as the base URL
// or set it manually
const response = await api("/private/endpoint", {
  origin: "https://api.example.com",
});
```

Why is this useful? Because you don't have to worry about headers, base URL, or other configurations. It's all done for you.
