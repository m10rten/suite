## Installation

### Requirements

To develop this `suite` you must have `pnpm` installed on your local system.

### Dependencies

Install the dependencies with the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Build

Build all the available projects with the following command:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will run `turbo` in the projects and execute the steps in parallel.
