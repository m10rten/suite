# Examples

This directory contains examples of any kind of code. It can be a simple script, a shared implementation of a common problem, or a full application.

## Directory Structure

The following is the directory structure for examples:

```txt
examples/
├── my-app/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── main.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

Naming conventions for directories and files are as follows:

Casing should be in `kebab-case` for directories and files. For example, `my-app`.

When using a framework or library, the name should start with that framework or library's name. For example, `go-` or `express-`.
The second part should be the name or problem the example solves. For example, `express-my-app` or `next-cache`.

Each example should be placed in its own directory. The directory should contain a `README.md` file that explains the example and how to run it.
